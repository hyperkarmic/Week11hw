# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. The _TLDR_ of this application is that we're creating a note taking app, it can be hard to keep track of the different thoughts and opinions in a meeting!

1. We're going to be using some CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete which map to POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) operations which are the Get, Post, Delete.

1. You're already given the frontend here, so it means we just need to hook everything up so the frontend will update!

1. It's important to process what the frontend is doing, make yourself familiar as it's going to be making calls to your backend, the frontend is essentially your tests/ folder :wink:

   > All it's doing is using jQuery to process the data, normally we're hooking up the jQuery, this time we're getting the data!

1. You're not given any JavaScript files so we need to define the structure of the folders and the files according to the routes we require.

# Submission Checklist :rocket:

1. Ensure that you submit both a link to your homework repo and a video of your application working!

   > Check for sneaky console errors and leftover console logs!

1. All the tests must pass!

1. Ensure what you've submitted works when you grade it yourself against the:

   - The user stories provided
   - The acceptance criteria's provided.

1. Make sure your homework repo has a quality README that _you_ have written, and provide a link inside of your README to the **deployed** Heroku application. _Do not provide a link to the heroku dashboard_.

1. Commit after most changes, all that code doesn't just appear first time :wink:

1. **Comment that JavaScript code :pray:**
