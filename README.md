#Note Taker
This is an app that reads, writes and deletes notes!

##Description
This is a the Trilogy/Manchester University week 11 homework.  This is an app, that has can take notes, allowing them to be read, saved and deleted, via POST, READ and DELETE API routes.  I have written a lot of the back end code, but the HTML, JQUERY and front end JavaScript was supplied.

##Visuals
A video of the functionality can be found at:

##Installation
Using terminal, enter the apps root directory and intialize NPM (npm init).  Also, express will need initializing (npm install express).  Then run the app off the command line, within the root directory (node server.js)

##Usage
